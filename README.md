The Reload Analyzer is a Qlik Sense application built for Qlik Cloud, which
provides an overview of data refreshes for your Qlik Cloud tenant.

It provides information such as:

* The number of reloads by type (Scheduled, Hub, In App, API) and by user
* Data connections and used files of each app’s most recent reload
* Reload concurrency and peak reload RAM
* Reload tasks and their respective statuses

## Installing/ updating

A PDF containing installation instructions is attached to each [release](/releases).
